```{R echo=FALSE}
# Load package
library(networkD3)
```

## simpleNetwork

For very basic force directed network graphics you can use simpleNetwork. For example:

```{R}
# Load package
library(networkD3)

# Create fake data
src <- c("A", "A", "A", "A",
        "B", "B", "C", "C", "D")
target <- c("B", "C", "D", "J",
            "E", "F", "G", "H", "I")
networkData <- data.frame(src, target)

# Plot
simpleNetwork(networkData)
```

## forceNetwork

Use forceNetwork to have more control over the appearance of the forced directed network and to plot more complicated networks. Here is an example:

```{R}
# Load data
data(MisLinks)
data(MisNodes)

# Plot
forceNetwork(Links = MisLinks, Nodes = MisNodes,
            Source = "source", Target = "target",
            Value = "value", NodeID = "name",
            Group = "group", opacity = 0.8)
```

From version 0.1.3 you can also allow scroll-wheel zooming by setting zoom = TRUE.

## sankeyNetwork

You can also create Sankey diagrams with sankeyNetwork. Here is an example using downloaded JSON data:

```{R}
# Load energy projection data
# Load energy projection data
URL <- paste0(
        "https://cdn.rawgit.com/christophergandrud/networkD3/",
        "master/JSONdata/energy.json")
Energy <- jsonlite::fromJSON(URL)
# Plot
sankeyNetwork(Links = Energy$links, Nodes = Energy$nodes, Source = "source",
             Target = "target", Value = "value", NodeID = "name",
             units = "TWh", fontSize = 12, nodeWidth = 30)
```

## dendroNetwork

From version 0.2, it is also possible to create dendrograms using dendroNetwork.

```{R}
hc <- hclust(dist(USArrests), "ave")

dendroNetwork(hc, height = 600)
```
